# Range Loops

This range loop:

```go
for i,v := range exp {...}
```

after compilation is similar to:

```go
expT := exp
lenT := len(exp)
for iT = 0; iT < leT; iT++ {
	i = iT
	vT := expT[iT]
	v = vT
	// original body
}
```

From this, we can note a couple of important details:

- The range loop expression `exp` is evaluated only once and is assigned to a temporary variable (a copy of the original)
- The variable `v` is a single variable that takes different values in each loop iteration
- The variable `v` is a copy of the loop element's value
- The variable `i` is a single variable that takes different values in each loop iteration
- The variable `i` is a copy of the loop index's value
