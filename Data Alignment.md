# Alignment Requirement

To improve memory efficiency data has to be aligned: primitive object of $K$ bytes must have an address that is a multiple of $K$.

Without alignment, two memory accesses are needed to fetch single primitive object split across two memory blocks

`x86-64` works regardless of the alignment of data, some others architectures don't.

# Satisfying Alignment Requirements

Alignment is enforced by making sure that every data type is organized and allocated in such a way that every object within the type satisfies its alignment restrictions.

- Initial address of the object (e.g. struct) must be aligned. Starting address for any block generated by a memory allocation function (`malloc`) must be aligned
- Every field inside object must be aligned
- Size of the object must be aligned to satisfy alignment for arrays of objects
- Stack frame may be aligned

If we have a type:

``` C
struct S {
	T1 f1
	T2 f2
	...
	Tn fn
}
```

where `Tmax` is the size of the biggest element's type `T1,â€¦,Tn`

Compiler must ensure (by adding **paddings**) that:

- Any pointer `p` of type struct `S*` satisfies the alignment - `*p` is a multiple of `Tmax`
- Each element `fi` satisfies the alignment - `&fi` is a multiple of `Ti`
- Size of the `S` is a multiple of `Tmax`
